App Description - 

The application is a web-based Local Pokedex that lets you add, review, and remove pokemon to your own Pokedex.
In addition, you can access a Global Pokedex that displays a list of Pokemon names and images using data obtained
from the PokeAPI, with a background video playing behind the content.
